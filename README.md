# Forecastr
> Quickly test financial viability of new products or services over a one year fiscal period

Forecastr calculates market sizing and segment parameters for new products or services, then compares
these against a forecast profit and loss projection plot to validate initial hypotheses.

## Usage example

Let's say you have some new software you are developing, you want to sell this on a SAAS basis.
You have some market data to work with - monthly sales, pricing and growth assumptions can be made with reasonable confidence.

**1. From your market data, enter:**

* Average estimated units shipped per month

* Estimated average sales price

* Target market segment you want to capture

* Estimate of how much this market will grow in percentage terms over a one year period

**2. Populate the fields for the actual profit & loss projection:**

* Estimated sales in the first month

* Your selling price

* The month-on-month sales growth you would like to achieve

* The month-on-month contribution margin growth desired

* Unit price increase month-on-month as a percentage

* Estimated cost of goods sold expense as a percentage

* Estimated revenue driven expenses as a percentage

* Estimated fixed cost base as a percentage

Forecatr will plot a P&L chart and compare initial segment size assumption against the actual P&L figures.
